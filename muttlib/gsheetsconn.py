Google Sheets <> Pandas connector

Remember it is crucial that you acquire correct Google Cloud Platform credentials
to interact with GSheets and GDrive APIs with authorization. This come in the form of a
json file whose path needs to be passed to this during initialization.
See the README.md for more details on how to acquire one.

A full round trip of how this module operates scan be seen as follows:

> import pandas as pd
> ​from muttlib import gsheetsconn
>
> GOOGLE_SHEETS_SECRETS_JSON_FP = "/some/local/dir/path/to/json/file.json"
> # A spreadhseet id is part of the url used in your browser
> GSHEETS_SPREAD_ID = "1psc7zc-yppfpmEUWAi6hW4GLstiPyZqlov6w6eATeuU"
> GSHEETS_WORKSHEET_NAME = 'test'
>
> gsheets_client = GSheetsClient(GOOGLE_SHEETS_SECRETS_JSON_FP)
>​
> # Construct random data from integers
> keys = list('ABC')
> numrows = 100
> str_length = 4
> df = pd.DataFrame(
>     pd.np.random.randint(0, 15, sizimport pandas as pd
> # And letters
> df['letters'] = pd.util.testing.rands_array(str_length, numrows)
​>
> # Test push working gsheets conn
> spreadsheet_id, worksheet = (GSHEETS_SPREAD_ID, GSHEETS_WORKSHEET_NAME)
​>
> gsheets_client.insert_from_frame(df, spreadsheet_id, index=True, worksheet=worksheet)
>​
> return_df = gsheets_client.to_frame(spreadsheet_id, worksheet=worksheet)

Google Sheets Credentials

To use the client in gsheetsconn.py one must first get the appropriate
credentials in Json format. These are provided by GCP (Google's computing platform - cloud).

Important note: to obtain the necessary credentials, one must first have a valid GCP account
which implies that billing for that account is already enabled. Having a standalone @gmail.com email
will generally not suffice. This reference may probably help: on billing and accounts support
for GCP.

A good and simple step by step guide on how to get the Json file credentials can be seen
in this medium post. These credentials will be used by our client to read/write/edit files
in Google Sheets.

The general idea is that in GCP we need to create or use an existing project, then enable
the Sheets and Drive APIs for the selected project and finally create new service-account
credentials for your script. Download them in Json format and put them somewhere accessible
to your script.

There are other types of credentials but in this way we can have a server-side script that does
not require explicit user consent to proceed with auth.

Important note: the service-account credentials will effectively provide us with a google-valid
email, which will act as the "user" editing/modifying/etc. the data in Google Sheets.

This implies that this service email needs to have sufficient permissions to actually
edit these files. In general, giving permissions to the needed sheets will suffice.
