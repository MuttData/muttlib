# muttlib

Library with helper code to start a project.

Current modules:
- `dbconn`: Somewhat homogeneus lib to access multiple DBs.
- `file_processing`: Helpers for concurrent file processing.
- `utils`: A single version of miscellaneous functions needed every now and then.
- `ipynb_const.py` and `ipynb_utils.py`: Utilities when for exploratory work.
