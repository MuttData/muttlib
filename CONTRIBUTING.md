# Contributing to muttlib

Thanks for your interest in contributing to muttlib ðŸŽ‰ These are the guidelines for contributions. Reading them will help you get started on how to make useful contributions.

## Foreword
This guide is not final. It will evolve over time, as we learn and add new voices to the project. Check it from time to time and feel free to make suggestions ðŸ˜ƒ

## Code of conduct

One of our core values at Mutt is that **we are an open team**. We all make mistakes and need help fixing them. We foster psychological safety. We clearly express it when we donâ€™t know something and ask for advice.

We expect everyone contributing to muttlib to follow this principle. Be kind, don't be rude, keep it friendly; learn, teach, ask, help.

## Issues

### Feature requests
To ask for new functionalities or improvements on muttlib, please head over to the [issues tracker](https://gitlab.com/mutt_data/muttlib/issues) and open a new issue with the label `feature-request` attached to it. 

A brief description of the desired functionality should be included; use cases and examples are welcome too, for a better understanding of the request.

Feel free to [open a new MR](#mrs) for it!


### Bug reporting
To report a bug, please check there is no previous related issue on the [issues tracker](https://gitlab.com/mutt_data/muttlib/issues) and then open a new issue with the `bug` label attached to it if there were none which addressed it. 

A MWE example of the bug should be provided to allow the person working on fixing it to save time reproducing and debugging it. Also, it should act as a test to check if whichever changes are made do effectively fix it. [MRs are welcome](#mrs) to fix them! 


#### Security issues

If you find a security related bug or any kind of security rellated issue, **please DO NOT file a public issue**. Sensitive security-related issues should be reported to privately to the repo owner along with a PoC if possible. You can [send us an email](mailto:security@muttdata.ai) and we'll go from there.
## Contributing

### Dev install
Start by cloning the repo
```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:mutt_data/muttlib.git
```

Then install all `dev` dependencies:
```bash
cd muttlib
pip install .[dev] 
```

#### pre-commit
We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run several code scans and hooks that make the development cycle easier. To install pre-commit hooks run
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install -t push
```

### Style guide
muttlib follows [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

If you installed the [pre-commit hooks](#pre-commit) you shouldn't worry too much about style, since they will fix it for you or warn you about styling errors. We use the following hooks:

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black): An opinionated code formatting tool that ensures consistency across all projects using it
- [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8): a tool to enforce style guide
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): a static type checker for Python 
- [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint): a source code, bug and quality checker 

#### Docstrings
We use either [numpy style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) or [google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings) docstring formatting. It's usually good to include the following docstrings:
- module level docstring giving a general overview of what it does.
	- it may include TODOs
	- it may include examples
- class dosctrings explaining what it is
- method/functions to explain what it does and what it's parameters are

### Testing
We use the [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to test muttlib. Check the [readme](https://gitlab.com/mutt_data/muttlib#testing) on how to run tests.

### Docs
Docs are generated with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with gitlab CI. Docs for master are available [here](https://mutt_data.gitlab.io/muttlib/).

The docs are automatically built from [docstrings](#docstrings). Check the [style guide](#style-guide) section for notes on docstrings.

### Versioning
We use [SemVer](https://semver.org). To keep things easy, we've included [bump](https://pypi.org/project/bump/) as a dev dependency. Running `bump` will bump the patch version. To bump minor/major versions:
```bash
bump --minor
bump --major
bump --patch
```

Please remember to bump the version when submitting your MR!

### Deprecation
Before fully deprecating a feature or making a breaking change, give users a warning and enough time for them to migrate their code. State when the EOL will be. Then, in the pertaining release, it can be included.

### MRs
muttlib development follows a simple workflow:
- assign yourself an issue
	- if there's none, [create it](#issues)
	- if you can't assign it yourself, ask someone to do it for you
- create a new branch with a descriptive name
- push to the remote
	- open a [WIP](#WIP) MR to allow discussion and let others know where you're at with the issue
- work on it ðŸ¤“
- when ready change the MR to [RFC](#RFC)
- you'll need at least one approval to merge
	- merge will be disabled if the [CI/CD pipelines are failing](#cicd-jobs)
	- if you can't merge it yourself, ask your last approver to merge it
	- please squash the commits and delete the branch
- congrats and thanks for your contribution ðŸŽ‰

Please keep MRs minimal. Try to keep the modified files to the bare needed for the issue you are working on. This will make the MR's changes more readable and allow for a quicker interaction with reviewers.

#### WIP
WIP stands for **W**ork **i**n **P**rogress. WIP MRs are not yet ready to be merged. They allow for:
- other project members to know you are working on something
- early feedback, e.g. if you are doing something wrong or they see a problem down the road with your approach

You can tag a MR as WIP using the `WIP:` prefix on you MR title.

#### RFC
RFC stands for **R**equest **f**or **C**omments. It means you consider the issue is solved by the code in the MR and are asking people to review your changes.

### CI/CD jobs
Gitlab CI/CD jobs are configured on [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/mutt_data/muttlib/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml). An overview of current jobs:

#### Test
[Regression testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing) to ensure new changes have not broken previously working features 

### README
Relevant changes (e.g. new modules) should be included in the README.
